                        One of the most effective practices of self-care
                    </h3>
                    <p>Journaling is an exercise that has been around for well over thousands of years. Journaling
                        follows a simple process of writing your thoughts without any rules or restrictions. The act of
                        self-reflection and routinely putting one’s experiences, feelings, beliefs, and emotions on
                        paper can do more good than just help you feel better. Especially when it comes to
                        self-improvement and leading a mindful life, journaling can be a great tool.</p>

                    <p>Mindful journaling is asking yourself why you feel a certain way and then letting it go out of
                        your head and onto the paper. You question yourself about yourself and get to know your values,
                        your motives, the way you think, and how you feel.<br> You take into consideration more possible
                        outcomes, study your situation, and thus shift your mindset. With the clarity of your thoughts,
                        You
                        stop going in the past, don’t look into the future, and become truly present and mindful of your
                        life.

                    <h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Journaling improves your mental health </h3>
                    <p>Journaling allows you to openly express your emotions that you usually keep bottled up. You
                        get an opportunity to have full emotional disclosure and vent without ever being judged. This
                        helps you feel lighter. Seeing your thoughts written in front of you in their true form without
                        any
                        edits helps you see the authenticity of your thinking.<br> In doing so, you identify your
                        triggers and learn to better handle them. When you write down and figure out the thoughts that
                        are
                        upsetting, you feel happier, calmer, less anxious, and experience overall better mental health.

                    <p>Journaling is your private space for decision making without any judgment or pressure. This
                        facilitates new perspectives and idea generation. You write different possible scenarios,
                        examine the positive and negative implications, and make better choices.<br> You build
                        self-awareness and discover things in your mind that might be affecting your behavior and moods.
                        You make your decisions and explanations more realistic and improvise better ways to achieve
                        your goals.
                        You may find out that the thing you are stressing about might not be that big of a deal and this
                        helps you approach it in a more bold manner.</p>

                    <p>Has been keeping journals since she was 13 years old. She considers them to be her therapy
                        sessions. They’re all simple leather diaries, locked away in a safe in her home. Every
                        boyfriend, every relationship, her friendships, her work, her family — all of them are
                        dissected on pages. Jen is not the type to get into huge, verbal altercations with her
                        boyfriends; her way of dealing with relationship issues has always been to write in her diary,
                        then have a
                        discussion. That way she always has the upper hand in fights, and never loses control.</p>
